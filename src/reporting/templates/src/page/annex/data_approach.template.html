            <h3>Automated EU Taxonomy and SFDR reports</h3>
              <section>
                <p>
        The recent EU Taxonomy regulation defines criteria to assess whether a given economic activity is to be considered as environmentally sustainable or not. The taxonomy itself is made of 88 activities that have been defined by the European legislator. To be considered as EU Taxonomic eligible, a company must conduct at least an economic activity present in this list.
                </p>
                <p>
         Companies’ alignment to EU Taxonomy is now a crucial consideration when it comes to its ESG performance assessment. Our technology can assess and align any company to the EU Taxonomy and perform eligibility checks in seconds. In addition, EU Taxonomy alignment is now required to be disclosed by financial institutions when publishing mandatory extra-financial reports such as SFDR. Our technology also calcultates PAI indicators for SFDR generation, as presented in the table below.

            <h3>Estimation Engine with continuous updates</h3>
              <section>
                <p>
        The EU Taxonomy is completed by Delegated Acts released by the European Commission.
        Not all the Delegated Acts have been published as of today which means some areas cannot be assessed in theory, such as waste management, circular economy, pollution prevention and protection/restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems.
                </p>
                <p>
                However our FINGREEN ENGINE can estimate the compliance and alignment of every company to those objectives based on ingestion of hundreds of other standards and practices. In addition, our knowledge database is constantly updated. In case of any evolution in regulations or publication of new Delegated Act we update our analysis promptly, faster than any of our competitors thanks to our own proprietary Programming Language.
