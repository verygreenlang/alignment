            <p>Our FINXAI ENGINE,
     powered by advanced Explainable Artificial Intelligence proprietary technologies,
      has selected {{data.number_of_metrics}} relevant metrics and indicators when it comes to benchmarking
      {{data.company_name}} versus its competitors selected for this analysis {% for item in data.competitors %}{{item}} {% endfor  %}.
       For the purpose of this sample report we focused our analysis on 3 metrics out of the 10 suggested by our engine: {% for item in data.metrics %}{{item}} {% endfor  %}.
    . {% for item in data.metrics_desc %}{{item}} {% endfor  %}.
            </p>
            <p>
            The analysis below ingested {{data.data_points}} data points and came to the following conclusion:
             {{data.company_name}} is performing better than one of its competitors
             {% for  key, value in data.worst_competitor.items() %} {{key}} with {{value}} {% endfor  %}.
             {{data.company_name}} is performing worst than one of its competitors

        <h3>Peer Analysis</h3><p>
Among the 3 big players (Apple, HP, and Samsung) in the electronics industry, there is no coordinated value that reflects the same trend over their GHG Emissions over Scope 1 and 2. Apple and HP's Scope 1 and 2 GHG Emissions dropped significantly in 2017, while Samsung's increased significantly starting 2016.

        Remarkably, Apple has a smaller GHG Emissions Scope 1 and 2 value compared to its peers, where HP is 50 times more than Apple and Samsung is 15 times more. However, most of the GHG Emissions of Apple products concentrate on upstream and downstream suppliers, which is one of the reasons that Apple's GHG Emissions Scope 1 and 2 are lower compared to peers. See full report for supply chain analysis.</p>
        <h3>FINGREEN Insights</h3><p>Apple decreased its Scope 1 and 2 GHG Emissions effectively by 40% since 2015, which overperforms its peers.

        Apple's carbon reduction strategies effectively and positively impacted its direct carbon emissions in Scope 1 and 2. These strategies include 100% renewable energy sourced for all Apple facilities and achieving carbon neutrality for its own operations in 2020.</p>
