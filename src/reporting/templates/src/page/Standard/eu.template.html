               As a public company, {{data.company_name}} can be aligned to various standards and frameworks. You have required that the analysis shall focus on one standard. We determined that the most relevant standard to apply to {{data.company_name}}, based on its activities and your profile, was the EU Taxonomy.</p>
            <p><span class="source">EU Taxonomy: EU Taxonomy regulation defines criteria to assess whether a given economic activity is to be considered environmentally sustainable or not. The taxonomy itself is made of 88 activities that have been defined by the European legislator. To be considered EU Taxonomic eligible, a company must conduct at least an economic activity present in this list. Companies’ alignment to EU Taxonomy is now a crucial consideration when it comes to their ESG performance assessment. FINGREEN technology can assess and align any company to the EU Taxonomy and perform eligibility checks in seconds.</span></p>
